# Z31-CLK
Replacement clock for Z31


Z31 GL clocks are a a 4-digit VFD driven by a HD44013 MCU. 

For no good reason I intend to replace all parts except the VFD, which uniquely operates directly DC voltage through a couple current limiting resistors and protection diodes. 

Replacement clock will source time from a new TCU design, and communicate over CAN, allowing it to serve as an interface to other accessories I've installed.
